You will need a maximum of eight quickdraws (six for the climbs, if leading, and two for the anchor rings at the top). All climbs have double rings at the top which makes it a user-friendly crag, but please, if top roping, do not take the 'European approach' and run your rope straight through the rings as this creates wear and tear.

This gem of a crag soon attracted a lot of interest and over the next 2 to 3 years a number of climbers from Hamilton, Auckland, Rotorua and Wharepapa put up near on sixty routes. The rock is a very compact fully welded Ignibrite with small edges lower down and pocketed nearer the top. The routes here require a totally different climbing style compared to their Ignibrite cousins down the road. The small holds and edges require balance and finesse as opposed to power and brute strength. The Main Cliff faces North and is situated on the side of a bush covered gully, with native trees right along the base and pine trees at the top. Access to the top of the cliff is difficult so all the routes have belay stations at or near the top of the cliff and descent is by abseil. There is a mix of sport climbs and trad climbing with some routes having a bit of both.\n\nThe first person to do any climbing around the Waipapa dam was Graeme Dingle, Corrina Gage and Andrew Cory in 1981. Graeme and Co paddle across the lake and put up 2 climbs on one of the small outcrops along side the lake directly opposite the road. These routes were forgotten about until the CNI guide was published. A few climbers started to develop some of the cliffs up above the road but despite it\u2019s appearance the rock here tends to be soft and friable and as a result there has been no further development in this area . There are numerous other account of people looking around the cliffs along side the powerhouse and immediately down stream of the dam but prior to Kevin Barratt discovering the main cliff there are no records of anyone doing any routes."},

So far there are about 32 routes up to 15m high and Grade 25.While the rock is generally better than nearby Farm Park often the top few metres of the cliff are of unstable blocks topped by steep grass consequently climbs may finish a bit short. The crag is sheltered from the easterlies more than \n and quite cool in summer. Most routes have double bolt belays with chain.\n\nHistory\n\nWhile it must have been known about in the early days it was left alone until Bill McLeod and Simon Middlemass moved around from Farm Park on an exploratory wander. They climbed \n (15) and \n (20) that visit. Mere days later the Athol Whimp and Gavin Tweedie team visited disillusioned with Farm Park and climbed the same natural lines thinking they were first ascents - Athol's \n being only a slightly different line to \n. They returned with Pete Sykes to bolt several other routes on the main wall before Pete left for Dunedin. It lay unvisited for several years while most of the original ascentionists were elsewhere.\n\nSimon harboured this as a secret crag while living in Wanaka and revisited on returning to Christchurch checking out lines and drilling the holes for \n. Hearing that Lindsay was writing a Port Hills Guide and checking out all the crags plus a desire to keep the Chain Link gangs out Simon headed back in January 1998 with Pat Deavoll. Finding lunch scraps and chalked holds one day and the discovery of Craig and Tony a few days later - (also surprised to see others there) led to a frenzy of climbing. After that more and more people turned up and it was unlikely to remain under wraps much longer. Most of the old routes were rebolted at this time."},

Climbers have visited Titahi Bay since the 1930s, at least. In 1970, Graeme Dingle published one of the first rock climbing guidebooks, noting that it was long overdue, and hoping that 'a guide of this nature will help in making rock climbing more enjoyable, thus raising the general standard'.\nDingle did not shy away from Titahi Bay's less attractive traits: 'the rock here is not always reliable and protection often inadequate'. This is still true, but there are also well-protected routes on good rock, especially since bolts began to be used in the mid-1980s. Double bolt belays were installed at the top of most routes around 2005."},

It offers up a handful of moderate multi-pitch adventures as well as some thought provoking trad lines. The Arboretum is also home to the notorious Gumboot Ledge, which has been described by one unnamed individual as \"the best climbing at Bullock Creek!\" and another as \"it's as loose and dirty as the route developers.\" I'm leaning towards the latter, although Arc of a Diver and Plan B are both classic in their own right"},

{"name": "Te Oka", "description": "Information\u00a0\u00a0By Tony Burnell/ Lindsay Main\u00a0also Previously hosted on website by John Davis\n\nSituation and Character\n\nThe crag overlooks Lake Forsyth and the township of Little River and is in a gloriously sunny location on the side of Te Oka about fifteen minutes from the road and about sixty minutes by car from Christchurch. The rock is obviously volcanic and, as one would expect, has the typical basalt pillar appearance. The rock can feel quite frictionless and, until the routes have had some traffic, there will be the odd loose, dirty hold. In truth, the main crag is steep and offers very little in the way of lower grade climbs, however on the plus side, all the routes are equipped with in situ gear and belays. If the gear isn't enough to tempt you, then the cafe at Little River should be. None of the routes are longer than 25 metres so a standard 50 metre rope is sufficient to lower off from the belays.\n\nAspect and Climate\n\nTe Oka is not fast-drying and after prolonged rain the seepage takes a long while to disappear, but it has remained climbable for the most part during this exceptional winter. The crag is situated high on the hillside about 500 m above sea level; it is sheltered and has a westerly aspect. The sun finds the crag around lunch time and stays til it sets behind the Southern Alps.\n\nHistory\n\nTe Oka was overlooked during the development on the Banks Peninsula mistakenly in my opinion (but who asked) apart from a fleeting visit by Phil de Joux and Martin Clarke. Only Phil stayed long enough to record the first route there 'Dark Tower'. In 1997 Alan Monnox introduced Pat Deavoll and Tony Burnell to the crag. That was his first mistake, especially if he was harbouring any secret desire to put up some new routes. During June and July 1997 Pat and Tony set about the development and the cleaning up of the previously bolted but unclimbed projects. After several weeks work, their tally rose to ten routes on the main crag, three of which were \n, \n and \n. Around the north side of the crag Alan added three traditional routes; hopefully they will have gone the way of all things back to nature."},

It gives a great day's climbing for a middle -grade climber. Some really high-quality routes in the 17-20 range are here, plus a pleasant setting and reasonable access. Generally the climbs follow well-developed finger/hand-size crack systems, and are free from loose rock and vegetation. The climbing style is varied, and the harder climbs tend to be the better quality ones.\nThe cliff is sheltered from the NE winds, and dries out quickly after rain."},

Offers full-pitch, moderate trad routes at either end of the crag on blocky ground, and a couple of bolted lines in the middle. With scope for more routes with some appealing lines on the steeper, smooth orange rock, this crag promises to be a nice lower-grade complement to the Wall of Sound.

Many proud and intimidating boulder problems rise up to eight metres above coarse sandy landings.

{"name": "Te Ananui", "description": "The rock at Te Ananui is rhyolite, typically horizontally banded and vertically\n\njointed, which makes for extremely positive holds and cracks that provide sound\n\nplacements. The rock quality is variable: in general where the rock is white, it\n\nhas weathered to a sandy, often salt encrusted and rounded form. Some routes\n\nhave gone on this rock, but as a best bet for the newcomer, it should be avoided!\n\nThere is a great deal of extremely solid rock, which is typically orange or yellow\n\nin colour. Most of the good routes follow cracks and seams on this rock, which is\n\nusually close to vertical. There are an abundance of positive holds, so that\n\ngrades tend to group around 16-18, although most are fairly strenuous. Having\n\nraved about how solid the rock is, take care since many of the routes have only\n\nbeen climbed once or twice, and there will be the odd loose rock. It's a very good\n\nidea for the belayer, if not the leader as well, to wear a helmet, and to stack the\n\nrope somewhere safe.\n\nJo Haines spotted the cracklines on Pohutukawa cliff in September 1991 and on\n\na subsequent visit with Dave Campbell they put up five routes in an afternoon.\n\nThese two were responsible for most of the early routes. Various other climbers\n\nvisited the beach during the summer, and in particular Mark Jones and Ray\n\nHollingsworth added an impressive string of routes.\n\nAccess to the top of the cliffs is difficult, so there is little here for the top-roping\n\nclimber. If you want to climb, bring your rack! There is good bouldering,\n\nespecially on Echo wall, with good landings on soft sand.\n\nGear;\n\nTo climb at Te Ananui you'll need a range of cams and wires of all sizes. Hexes\n\neven come in handy. Flexible camming units are especially handy as there are\n\nlots of deep horizontal breaks. RP's have even been used on Echo wall where\n\nthe tight seams allow good placements (although you'll probably need to\n\nconvince yourself of that!). Slings are needed for runners around trees.\n\nOf the nearly 70 routes at Te Ananui, only a handful use bolts for protection. It\n\nwould be nice to see this ratio of bolts to natural pro. remain.\n\nThe gear you will need - a full rack of cams and wires plus hexes if you have\n\nthem, and 11 quickdraws."},

Avoid  it in a southerly.\n\nHistory\n\nThe crag was first visited by a group of wandering climbers in 1973, producing a series of excellent routes. These are the classic ***Ultimate Horror  (16) - later \"enhanced\" with two bolts and *Deviant (17) by Tim Wethey, **Oblivion (16) by Mike Franklin, *N.S.U (14 ) by Mike Perry, and *Diploma (14) by Warwick Anderson. These visits established the crag, but the next new route was not until five years later with Hugh Logan\u2019s **Eliminator (18). The crag\u2019s hardest climb was produced by John Allen in 1979: Walk on the Mild Side (23). This necessitated a 7m fall due to removing hands from the rock at the wrong time! Another Allen prize was **Altar (21), the spectacular arete that gives the crag its profile. This was top-roped in 1973, but the difficulty (for the time) and limited protection preserved it for seven more years. Also climbed in 1980 were John Howard\u2019s Falter (22) and Greenstick Fracture (20). Roddy McKenzie added Cabbage Milkshake (22). During the 1990s the crag had a few new routes put in by Hamish Dunn & Rob Battersby, mixing trad climbing in with bolts. Alan Hill and friends also put up some trad routes, mainly on the small cliffs to the left of the main wall, during the 90s and early 2000s.\n\nIn 2011 seismic events forced a re-evaluation of local climbing, and Otepatotu became a preferred destination because of the absence of damage to the crag and ease of access. A track was cut to the base, all the existing lines were cleaned, and many new routes and variations were added, the main protagonists being Joe Arts, Lindsay Main, and Hugh Logan. A few routes (The Ultimate Horror and Dead Heroes) were retro-bolted, and bolt anchor stations were established along the top of the crag. Gorse-infested corners were cleaned out and development started on the left side of the main cliff (left of Walk on the Mild Side), resulting in about 15 new routes and variations. Many of these were of unexpected quality.\nApart from the main crag, with routes listed below, there are three smaller crags to the left, the Left, Middle, and Right Buttresses.

Calum Hudson first climbed there in 1972, and returned over the next six years to develop most of the routes, with cameo appearances by another three of the country\u2019s most influential 1970s climbers, Rick McGregor, Murray Jones and Murray Judge. Calum writes:\n\n\u2018Rumour had it that Mihiwaka was very loose and steep and that one would require a stepladder to start most of the climbs. One day in \u201972 myself with Rob Turner, Bryan Laws and Dave Begg decided to investigate, and discovered a hidden treasure. We didn\u2019t climb there that day but carried on to Long Beach. A short while later Bruce Clarke, Russ Mercier and Ken Calder climbed Deep Wide and Frequent and I followed shortly after with Phil Herron and Eugenie Ombler to embark on the longest lead of my life at the time, creating Living in the Past, and then all hell broke loose...\u2019\n\nThe only new routes to be climbed in the following 20 years are Luke Newnham\u2019s eliminate Under the Volcano, and Dave Brash\u2019s route on the steep wall and prow left of Top Cat. Unwilling to place the first bolt at Mihiwaka, he stuck his neck out on the unfashionably serious Pasta la Pizza. Call me old-fashioned, but it would be nice if this crag remained a bolt-free monument to the 1970s  \u2018clean climbing\u2019 movement.\n\nAfter many years with few visitors, Mihiwaka is justifiably experiencing a minor renaissance. Its easier climbs generally offer better quality and protection for aspiring trad leaders than Long Beach.  A rack of medium to large gear with heaps of slings (save some for the manuka tree belays at the top) will see you up most of the climbs. In keeping with the 1970s ambience, this is hex country.

A few climbs were put up in the 1960s and 1970s, usually following obvious cracks or ledges, but the area was virtually forgotten through the 1980s and into the 1990s.\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham, put up in 1993 by Paul Hersey and Hugh Nicholson was probably the first route for about 15 years, and generated a growing enthusiasm for what some consider is the best northern climbing area beyond the Mt Eden Quarry. During the mid 1990s interest in the area accelerated, with a mixture of new sport routes and multipitch classics. Of all the climbers who have spent time at Mangaraho, John Maine probably has the closest affinity. He treats it witha respect it deserves \u2014 and occasionally demands when you\u2019re three pitches up and unsure which way to go!\n\nClimbing notes\n\nThis is a big chunk of rock, and it\u2019s advisable to familiarise yourself with a few landmarks that may help with route-finding before jumping onto the North Face.\n\nLook for the obvious cave on the Cave Route at the right hand end of a large tree covered ledge halfway up the eastern end of the North Face. Confused?\n\nWhen you spot the cave, a small grassy ledge immediately on its right is the belay point for the end of the second pitch of Green Eggs and Ham.\n\nFurther right and down is the large left-leaning crack of The Dihedral.\n\nFrom the carpark you should also be able to see the freestanding altar-shaped boulder at the northern end of the face.\n\nRoute finding abilities are a definite advantage on the North Face, as there is not always a line of bolts to follow. In contrast, the Trinity Slabs area is generally straightforward and a useful introduction. The West Ridge is another popular warm-up route.\n\nThe plug is about 120m high, and the rock is generally sound. There are, however, a number of flaky patches, usually close to the ground. Some routes are bolted, but others require a full range of natural pro. There is a mixture of climbs; while some of the older routes are now overgrown andobsolete, others have stood the test of time to be viewed as classics. If tackling a long North Face route, be prepared to be on the climb for over three hours (the first ascent of Green Eggs and Ham took six hours). There is no water nearby, but camping is sometimes allowed by the local landowner. Ask at the house on the left as you turn onto the gravel road.\n\nA final warning: Beware the Mangaraho Possum. On more than one occasion climbers have had to bail from prospective routes due to furry requests from manic marsupials."},

Once the choss has been negotiated you will be rewarded  by wonderful climbing  on shallow basalt organ pipe extrusions offering a multitude of intricate movement options in sustained sequences. The protection is excellent on nearly all of the routes, unless described in the guide. Take a good trad rack \u2013 offset wires and small cams are very handy. Having the skill and endurance to use them is also helpful. Take care when rapping off! The raps are at the danger length and the ground slopes away below.\nWith an observation platform at the lip of the amphitheatre, Lovers Leap was hardly a secret. Murray Judge looked at it in the early 1970s, but development had to wait for the arrival of the power drill. Al Ritchie first put up routes here in 1998. They were impressive ground up efforts, which included leading through the horror show bands of choss. He raved about the potential, but disappeared into the Wanaka scene, never to be heard of again. In December 2000, Steve Carr and Dave Brash, abseiled in to check it out. They discovered beautiful organ pipes defended from above and below by bands of terrible rock. Amazingly they had the crag pretty much to themselves for a couple of years. Keith Riley returned to Dunedin and could not believe the \u201cbest single pitch crag in the country\u201d had miraculously appeared in his absence.

{"name": "Mangaokewa", "description": "Come Sample the Steepness!!!\n\nThe climbing potential for this gem of a crag was first discovered due to rain.\n\nRyan von Haeseley, an ex-pat turned Waitomo local, had moved to the\n\nWaikato from Wellington in order to be closer to good rock. He was not let\n\ndown. Most of the King Country is riddled with limestone outcrops, from the\n\nbouldering at the \"Airstrip\" to the multi-pitch trad and sport lines of Mangaotaki.\n\nWhat he didn't count on was the rainy west coast weather...\n\nOne rainy morning he woke up and decided he had had enough. It was time to\n\nfind a dry place to climb. He wasn't too picky; his ideal situation would be to\n\nfind a crag that was steep enough to keep off the rain, had cool features to play\n\non, had someplace nearby to camp, had running water and toilets, and could\n\noffer a little bit for both boulderers and ropeguns alike. He grabbed a few maps\n\nof the region and started patching together locations that looked suitable,\n\nhopped in his car and headed off. He found what he was looking for...and a\n\nwhole lot more.\n\nThe limestone bluffs of the Mangaokewa Scenic Reserve are less than a 5\n\nminute drive from Te Kuiti. This means that climbers can easily pick up\n\nsupplies and a good feed at the end of a day on the rock. The reserve also\n\noffers free camping, flush toilets, BBQ pits and a river (complete with\n\nwaterfalls). Due to the overhanging nature of much of the rock, climbing here is\n\nnot hampered by bad weather. In fact, because the cliffs are broken up into two\n\ndistinct tiers (the upper tier being more consistently overhung) it is possible to\n\nplay on easy vertical and slab climbs on the first tier because most of them\n\nare protected from rain by the cliffs above. Many of the shorter overhangs offer\n\nexcellent, all-weather bouldering potential as well. Most enticing to climbers is\n\nthe abundance of dead stalactites to play on, hanging from many of the roof\n\nlines...some of them look as if they were out of an international climbing\n\nmagazine!\n\nWord of the \"North Island's Payne's Ford\" spread quickly and Ryan soon had a\n\nfair bit of help to develop the crag. The likes of Matt Natti, Tom Johns, Kaitlin\n\nO'Reilly and Dan Head quickly became regulars at the cliff. Tom, on top of\n\nbeing a new routing machine, sorted out access issues with the help of local\n\nclimber/caver Ollie Polson. Matt took on the daunting task of building a \"user\n\nfriendly\" track up to the cliff and lots of others simply hopped on the\n\ndevelopment bandwagon, scrubbing and bolting to get enough climbs\n\nestablished to warrant a guide. As word continued to spread and routes\n\ncontinued to go up the popularity of the crag, both for climbers and developers,\n\ncontinued growing rapidly. The fact that within the first three months of the crag\n\nbeing discovered over 30 routes had already been established is astounding.\n\nHopefully this is a sign of things to come for this extraordinary climbing venue.\n\nThe Rock\n\nThe rock is limestone and generally solid, featured. Being a new crag which\n\nhas had little traffic there are a few sections which may have some loose rock.\n\nHelmets are recommended especially when belaying. It should also be\n\nmentioned that there are sections of a softer, sandstone type rock (as seen\n\nbetween the two tiers of the colesseum) which is quite unstable. All that being\n\nsaid.... most route development has involved the removal of as much \"bad\"\n\nrock as possible so get out there and enjoy the routes!\n\nThe Guide:\n\nAll routes listed in \u0394 in this guide have been tagged to make figuring out where\n\nyou actually are a bit easier. The routes are listed from left to right for each\n\nsection.\n\nThis guide is also using a 3 star system for routes, though so far they are all\n\nquality!

Although very steep or overhanging, most routes are infested with holds of all shapes and sizes and are not very technical.

Some of the climbs are so overhanging that short showers may pass un-noticed. It gets wet from seepage after rain. The Ataturk wall is sheltered from the easterly, and unlike the rest of the crag gets afternoon/evening sun, making it a good choice for after-work sessions.\n\nClimbing Notes\n\nMany of the routes have bolts and hangers, and belay/rappel anchors exist at the top of \n routes (notable exceptions being \n and \n. Descents are usually a scramble along the top and down the side of the crag, avoid crossing the fenceline at the top of the crag as the land beyond this is private property (it's almost always preferable to abseil).

Pack your brave pills and your flying goggles.\nLine topos are approximations of the actual route position\n\nHistory\n\nLittle had been done here up until 1970 except for aid routes, with Stu Allen being a big contributor. 1971 saw work from Ross Gooder resulting in \n (16). In the next ten years only five routes were added, probably the best being \n (17) by Rob Rainsbury in 1975. Then in 1982 Lyttelton Rock was refound. John Visser did the unrelentingly steep \n (21) up an old aid line, which started a feeding frenzy by Lindsay Main and Joe Arts in 1982-83. Great climbs such as \n (21), \n (21), \n (20) (all Arts), and \n (17) and \n (21) (Main) date from then. In 1984, Ton Snelder and Roger Parkyn hopped on the wagon. With this new blood and bigger and better bolts to protect the steep walls, the cliff gave superb test-pieces like \n (23) and \n (23) (Snelder) and serious propositions like \n (21) (Parkyn). Their efforts culminated in the publishing of a now-classic guidebook in 1985. Where possible, their original route descriptions have been used.\n\nThings then slowed, but didn't stop. In 1987, Steve Schneider added \n (23) up one of the old aid lines. Dave Fearnley also made contributions, with \n (26) and the phenomenally steep \n (25). The late 80s saw the ascent of \n (27) and other steep things before the quest for horizontal rock lead people to the Superbowl aka The Cave. Activity then ceased through most of the mid-90s.\n\nTony Burnell's arrival in 1996 saw a rebirth, with many new routes (\n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n), and a few other people snuck in some new climbs as well (Kynan Bazley with \n and John Chambers with \n)."},

The rock is trachyte and is mostly solid, with excellent friction, but is a bit dirty in places because of the small number of ascents. Most routes use a mix of bolts and natural pro. The climbs are about 8-15 metres long. There are six anchor stations at the top - four of them use double bolts and chains, but two combine a single chain with a convenient hex or cd placement. A mid-sized CD is useful on many routes.\n\nThe crag is free of the elitism found elsewhere in that even the easy routes are well protected, with bolts where necessary. With grades ranging from 11 to 23 there's something for everyone, but not many routes at any particular grade.\n\nSome of the climbs are being modernised with more fixed protection.\nNOTE: The four climbs between 'Edna' and 'Broken Turbine' have been destroyed by the earthquakes."},

There is space to park a few vehicles on the edge of the road at the valley entrance. 15-20 minutes casual walk following a cairned route gets you to a large dice shaped boulder.  \nThis is a sub-alpine area. The land is administered by the Department of Conservation and is zoned recreational. The Department has given permission for the area to be developed for rock climbing, however the environmental impact is to be minimal. There are currently no toilets at the site.\nThe climbing area consists of a number of separate crags and short walls. In the winter the area is snow covered although climbing is still possible (some fun mixed routes exist). The rock is compact sandstone (highly oxidised greywacke) and generally very solid. The bulk of the cleaning required has been removal of loose blocks and rocks from ledges, cracks, and hollows. Due to winter freeze/thaw actions there is no guarantee that once cleaned routes are forever clean. The style of climbing should be approached as a blend of crag and alpine. Generally the routes put up are a mix of in situ and traditional. It is advisable to carry a good rack of cams (flexes are a must), and nuts including RPs. The vast majority of routes have chain anchors. Bolts are 10mm diameter stainless steel with hangers. Chain anchors are 12mm diameter galvanised linked with standard steel chain and shackles. \nClimbs are described from left to right as you face the cliffs. All climbs at these cliffs are graded Technical.\nHistory\n\nIt seems likely the first people to climb here were Russell Braddock and Guy Cotter in 1987.

A surge of development in 1995-6 has resulted in over twenty routes including several excellent lines, and scope for several more.\nBeing south facing, it gets virtually no direct sunlight, making it an ideal place to hide on hot nor-west days. It is also surprisingly well sheltered from the north-easterly, but is exposed to the southerly. The orientation makes it somewhat lichenous but it is surprisingly clean and dry.\nGrazing animals (particularly rabbits) have stripped most of the native vegetation in the area except what they can't reach. The result is an area with little other than grass and broom but with a good collection of native plants on the cliff itself including ferns, shrubs, and extensive clumps of orchids. Care has been taken to avoid damaging these plants and if you are cleaning new routes, please respect this approach. There are also numerous skinks and geckos around the top of the cliff - please consider their habitat requirements when moving rocks.\nRoutes are up to 22m in length, on steep rock of a type similar to that at Lyttelton Rock and tend to be sustained and strenuous. With a few exceptions, most of the routes are partly or totally bolt protected, ie. some routes require other gear as well, but watch out for crumbly rock. There have been some campaigns to rebolt a lot of the climbs to modern standard, but there are a few climbs that require trad climbing skills.\n\n\nThis crag still has a few areas of loose rock- climb accordingly.\nDescriptions are from left to right.\nThe road (left hand) end is generally less steep, with more vegetation, looser rock and fewer clear lines. The centre of the crag has the best rock and most obvious lines. A bit right of the cave the rock is a bit rotten, but then improves again.

{"name": "Crag X", "description": "On the eastern side of Mt Pleasant just south of the summit ridge, and just west of the old World War II concrete gun emplacements. The crag faces west, and runs south from the zig-zags in the track up to the gun emplacements.\nThere's good shelter from the north-east, and it's nice and sunny on a winter afternoon. It can be hot in summer. It's exposed to the south, but there's a degree of shelter in a north-wester, though others would be preferred.\nThere are 24 climbs ranging from 14 to 22, concentrated in grades 20-21, and most of these are excellent climbs. Most routes are well protected, many with bolts, but three of the oldest routes, on the right end of the cliff, are awaiting re-bolting and the bolts may not be safe.\nThe rock is the coarse-grained Mt Pleasant trachyte, which gives excellent friction. As with all the Mt Pleasant cliffs, beware of loose flakes, especially as many climbs have had only a few ascents.\nThe initial climbing by Brian Fish and Joe Arts in 1981 of five routes on the south-facing right hand end was an odd quirk in the development of Christchurch climbing. At Lyttelton Rock, Scratching Julius, which was the catalyst for development of the crag, had not yet been done. To reach Crag X more accessible crags were bypassed, and the largest part of the crag was ignored. Little wonder that the crag was mostly left alone for a decade, until Joe Arts started a second phase of development in 1991-92, of which the notable route was the crag's showpiece, Gripping Scales.\nFinally, in October 1997 Lindsay Main and Joe Arts set some kind of a record by doing eight new routes during one hot spring day to clean up most of the obvious remaining lines.\n\u00a0"},

{"name": "Froggatt Edge", "description": "Froggatt Edge was original found by Margot Harkness in 1990, a discovery that marked the\n\nstart of the climbing migration away from Wharepapa South (Castle Rock). Luke Newnham\n\nwas the first to put up climbs at Froggatt and kicked things off with, Monsterpiece Theatre,\n\nBete Noire & Sunstrike, not a bad start!\n\nLuke then introduced the climbing world to Froggatt during the area\u2019s first ever bouldering\n\ncomp. Following this a small group of Auckland based climbers set about bolting and\n\nclimbing this expanse of unclimbed rock and within a year there were 38 routes at the crag.\n\nWhen Pete Mannings \u201cCNI Rock\u201d was published in 1992 it included these 38 routes, it also\n\nlisted the new route potential at Froggatt as being only \u201cmodest\u201d. With this most moved\n\nonto develop some of the area\u2019s other crag\u2019s leaving Luke Newnham, Ton Snelder and\n\nDave Vass to put up some of the crag\u2019s harder lines. Andrew Wilson and co then pitched\n\nin and added a long list of first ascents. In 1996 Andrew Wilson then published a guide for\n\nFroggatt which include about 70 routes. The crag was re-bolted in 1997-98, during this re\n\nbolting a lot of the lines between routes were filled in and new areas like Slug Wall were\n\nopened up. By the time Dave Moorhouse\u2019s guide was published in 1998 there were over\n\n110 routes, not bad for a crag with modest new route potential.\n\nThe next significant development at Froggatt was not climbing related, but rather a\n\ncommercial development. The owner of \u201cCastle Rock\u201d brought Froggatt and began to\n\ndevelop both crags for commercial climbing purposes. The new owner set about\n\ntransforming the crag ready for commercial use, scrub was removed, lines rebolted and\n\npaths and sign posts installed.

This isn't your average sport climbing destination, but it has something for everyone.\n\nNorth-facing limestone crags that are generally weather proof. There are quite a few good climbs here at various grades, and a lot more climbing to be developed.\n\nHistory\n\nDevelopment of the area began with a visit from Robin Hood back in 1985-86 when Robin and a mate put up two climbs at Hanging Gardens (Dogs in Space and a project which later became The Great Gatsby). This was the very first stage of Bullock Creek development and it ended when the river flooded and Robin was forced to swim to the wall to recover his gear. Next came a group of Greymouth climbers led by Bruce Dowrick in 1999 who put up a selection of climbs at Hanging Gardens before having a disagreement with DOC over the unsightliness of a static rope. The disagreement halted development until 2008, when Jack Grinsted fired the cannon and called in some legendary Kiwi climbers including Lindsay Main, Joe Arts and Neil Silverwood who also saw the potential shimmering in the cliff now known as the Arboretum. Over the next few years Jack and various merry men returned to put up new lines in both Bullock Creek and the Punakaiki River Valley.\n\nThe winter of 2014 saw a heap of development from Neil Silverwood and Neil Warrington who put up nearly two dozen new pitches. As of January 2015 Bullock Creek has undergone its biggest development phase to date with funding graciously provided by a Sport New Zealand Hillary Expedition Grant. The team received funding to put up 30 new routes in 30 days at the newly found Paradise Crag and its outlying walls, with the help of many visiting friends.\n\nBullock Creek lies within the Paparoa National Park. Route Developers and Climbers should take care to preserve and protect the the conservation and cultural values of the area. Specific care should be taken not to disturb Gossamer Grass (Anamenthale lessonia) a 'Nationally Vulnerable' species. Also note that bivy caves may be considered culturally sensitive by Ngati Wae Wae.\nDuring the past few months there has been confusion and argument over whether bolting climbs at Bullock Creek is acceptable to the Department of Conservation. This issue is now over, with DOC and NZAC in agreement that the Bullock Creek area is suitable for the development of bolted climbs. The forthcoming management plan for Paparoa National Park will reflect this."},

In 2006 Kevin Barrett and Richard Knott visited Buck Rock and put up the 2 pitch line of \u201cDemo of Bosh\u201d. Kevin then returned with Stephen Barrett and added 3 more routes. Kevin continued to preach \u201cto anyone that would listen\u201d about how good this crag was and the enormous potential for new routes, but he failed to drum up any interest and when he moved down south development stopped. A little slow on the up take I may be, but in late 2009 I return to the crag and along with other local Hamilton climbers started to develop Buck Rock. As it turns out Kevin was right, the climbing is great, the rock quality is great, the outlook is fantastic and the potential for long single or multi pitch climbs is enormous.\n\nClimbing Notes.\n\nYou will need up to 12 Quickdraws.

{"name": "Britten Crag", "description": "Local climbers including some of the crag developers have had a look over and climbed at Britten Crag.  Overall the crag has survived remarkably well, considering it's close proximity to the 22/2 epicentre.  Over 90% of the climbs appear to be unaffected with some areas of major rockfall confined to limited areas and the crag can still be accessed from either end.\nThe damaged areas include The Roofs, Winter Wall (centred around 12XU) and of course Shit Buttress which collapsed in the Sept 4th quake.\nThe rock falls at both The Roofs and Shit Buttress have left a large deposit of fallen rocks covering the track so please take particular care when crossing.  If coming in from the lower end, it's best to drop down a couple of metres at this first rockfall to cross rather than clambering over the rocks, which may dislodge some down the hill.\nTake more care than usual when on routes, if you do happen to find a loose rock, find a safe direction to drop it and take all the normal precautions that you would when climbing at a newly developed crag.  When this crag went through it's major development phase in the early 2000's, many rocks were safely dropped down when routes were cleaned, without them rolling down the hill to the fence.\nIf you find any damaged climbs that haven't been identified already, list them here.

{"name": "Chasm Crag", "description": "The development of the Chasm Crag has helped promote an interest in modern alpine rock routes within the Darran Mountains, primarily by giving an all weather crag to play on while the high peaks are suffering from Fiordland weather.\n\nThe Chasm Crag offers three to four pitch climbs on clean steep diorite with the upper pitches protected from the rain by enormous roofs. Climbing here in a torrential downpour, on dry rock enclosed within sheets of water pouring over roofs in a 70-metre cascade, is a unique experience not to be missed.\n\n\n\nClimbers tend to pick their way around the crag by climbing access pitches and then traversing or rapping to other anchors. A happy day can be spent linking up climbs without having to descend to the soggy forest floor. When lowering someone off the steep upper pitches, you may need to throw them a line to pull the climber in and it may be better to down-climb steep routes to retrieve gear.\n\nIt is recommended that single 60-metre rope be used, and a tag line may be useful for the long abseils. A comprehensive rack of natural pro along with quick-draws should be enough for most routes. If any extra bits are required a mention is made in the route description.\n\n\n\nDevelopment of the Chasm Crag began in 1993 when Paul Rogers and visiting Brit Steve Walker took a closer look at those flashes of white seen through the Cleddau bush. The first route to be completed was High Ideals and Crazy Dreams. The quality of moves on a variety of features drove them on to try all the main features on the right-hand end of the crag. One Way Ticket and Day Tripper were soon added. The next area of exploration were the slabs and overhangs on the left-hand end of the wall. The lower parts yielded some excellent natural pro climbing, however the overhanging upper wall soon became the centre of attention. A couple of days sky hooking and jug pulling produced Buster Gonad. Chris Plant made the first onsight of this outrageously steep route. Along with visiting Brits, some of the Wanaka posse gave up the wire bush and headed to the deep south. Steve Henry and Dave Roberts \u2018touched and felt\u2019 their way up a few climbs. Including quality teenage climbs that work there way up to the Chill-Out Ledge. Hugh Barnard bolted Jack the Biscuit, an exposed ramp moving left off the Chill-Out Ledge. The a year or so later Paul was back with Kevin Nicolas to create Vertically Challenged which takes a steep dyke on the right-hand wall.\n\nMore recently the Sedon brothers have been bitten by the bug (along with a few sandflies) adding routes in the Hidden Wall while Murray Ball (the cleaner) put up the classic Mr Wolf, below the Chill-Out Ledge."},

{"name": "Charleston", "description": "Check the weather, check the tide, check the swell!\nGreat rock climbing exists on seacliffs near Charleston, on the West Coast between Greymouth and Westport. The cliffs are up to 40 metres high and consist of gneiss, a metamorphised granite. The quality is generally good. A great variety of climbing is found: delicate face climbs, crack climbs, chimneys, corners and overhangs. The holds are usually large and the harder climbs are steep. Friction is excellent. Most are easy to middle grade, with only few hard routes. Many fantastic lines await ascents. Most climbs are walk on and walk off.\nThe West Coast has a reputation for rain, but often it is enjoying a glorious fine spell when it\u2019s raining in Canterbury. Climbing is very pleasant throughout the year. \nRoutes are described from north to south, and left to right facing the cliffs. Access is walk-on, with wave-cut platforms at the base of the cliffs. Be wary of waves breaking over the platform, and keep clear of surge holes. Cover up against sandflies.\nGenerally the rock is sound \u2013 often perfect \u2013 but care needs to be taken with occasional loose blocks and flakes, particularly on first ascents. Bring a good rack with CDs, hexes, wedges, and so on.  Climb it as you see it.\nWe apologise to any first ascentionists not credited. There is a strong local convention of on-sight leading of new routes: \u201cThese cliffs suit the adventurous, and not so much the tricksters.\u201d So let's try for that ideal, and report first ascent methods precisely. Some new routes will need bolts though, and these should be placed in the best positions from a top rope. Bolts, hangers and inserts must be of stainless steel only, because of the high corrosion rate.\nEarly use was made of the cliffs by Buller High School under the watchful eye of Paul Caffyn. Since then, more than 170 routes have been led. Key figures in the development of the cliffs include Paul Wopereis, Ronan Grew, and Rick Harding.

{"name": "Castle Rock", "description": "A prominent volcanic feature with classic, airy routes. Solid rock, good climbs in most grades and easy access make Castle Rock Christchurch\u2019s most popular crag. You can find somewhere sheltered to climb on most days. Probably the crag with the longest tradition of climbing in Canterbury, Castle Rock is handily located just above the Heathcote valley. It offers a good mix of traditionally protected routes up to about grade 24, and even a few bolt-protected harder routes (most notably The Cave Route).\nThis is definitely the longest-used rockclimbing area in the Canterbury region. Many of the routes were aided, and the area was regarded as just a belaying training area. Unfortunately, there was little recorded history prior to Don Hutton's 1968 guide, though there is a mention of rock falls in 1967 (hence the name Cannonball Gully for the area left of the Cave). So all the names of existing climbs originated from the 1968 guidebook editors, and no first ascentionists are credited. One preserved early name, from 1940, is `Hamilton's Crack' for Hawk/Eagle Cleft. After the publishing of the first guide, there was little development. Then in 1971 Rob Rainsbury added \n 18. Allegedly he thought it was the normal finish to \n 16 and became committed. Also that year, Bill Denz led the very necky \n 18 with minimal pro. 1972 saw Colin Dodge complete \n 20, the first climb at this grade at Castle Rock. Rob Rainsbury added the excellent \n 18. Murray Judge (the Southern Raider) pulled off the plum of \n 20. In 1974 John Barnett did \n 19.\nLittle was added then until 1978. As some of his earliest efforts in NZ, John Allen added \n 21, \n 19 and \n 19. 1979 saw an increase in activity and visitors such as Tobin Sorenson, who did the testing \n 24 and soloed \n 21. John Allen came out with \n 23. Rick McGregor produced the bold classic \n 22 and Dave Fearnley added \n 21, one of his earliest new routes.\n1980 saw John Allen become the \n 22, following John Howard's good efforts in placing all the protection. Allen and his team then turned their attention to the steeply overhanging Barbican Wall. \n 24 and \n 23 resulted. The last route was aptly named as it represented the first `real' use of a bolt at Castle Rock. Allen paid `fifty cents a day' for a student labourer to drill the hole, which took 2 days with Mike Law's massive sandstone bit. 1981 saw Brian Fish do the other obvious lines on this wall, the pumpy \n 25 and \n 24. Visitor Charlie Creese added \n 24, and Dave Fearnley did the last of the cracks on the Keep, \n 24.\nFearnley published a guide to Castle Rock in 1982, which contained some 130 routes for the Rock, which was nearly 100 more than the 1968 guide. Following that there was a definite slowing of pace. Perhaps Castle Rock has basically been mined-out!\nClimbing Notes\n. Descents from other areas are fairly straight forward."}]
